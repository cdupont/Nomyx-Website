<h2>Nomyx</h2>
<h4>The only game where You can change the rules!</h4>

<br />
Nomyx is a unique game where you can change the rules of the game itself, while playing it! <br />
In fact, changing the rules is the goal of the game. Changing a rule is considered as a move. Of course even that could be changed! <br />
The players can submit new rules or modify existing ones, thus completely changing the behaviour of the game through time. <br />
The rules are managed and interpreted by the computer. They must be written in the Nomyx language, based on <a href="http://www.haskell.org">Haskell</a>.<br />
This is the first complete implementation of a <a href="http://www.nomic.net">Nomic</a> on a computer. <br /> 
<br />
At the beginning, the initial rules are describing:<br />
- how to add new rules and change existing ones. For example a unanimity vote is necessary to have a new rule accepted.<br />
- how to win the game. For example you win the game if you have 5 rules accepted.<br />
But of course even that can be changed!<br />
<br />
Here is a <a href="http://vimeo.com/58265498">video introduction</a> and first tutorial of the game. <br />
<a href="http://www.nomyx.net:8000/Nomyx">The game is running here</a>  <br />
The <a href="http://www.nomyx.net/forum">Forum</a> is used to learn about Nomyx and discuss the rules during a game. <br />
