{"name":"Nomic","tagline":"The game where you can change the rules","body":"Nomic\r\n=========\r\n\r\nA Nomic game in Haskell\r\n\r\nThe original game: www.nomic.net\r\n\r\nNomic is a fabulous and strange game where you have the right to change the rules in the middle of the game!\r\n\r\nIn fact, changing the rules is the goal of the game. Changing a rule is considered as a move. Of course even that could be changed!\r\n\r\nIn this game, the player can enter new rules in a dedicated language, modify existing ones, thus changing completely the behaviour of the game!\r\n\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\n\r\nTo install, follow this procedure:\r\n- download the source tar.gz\r\n- extract it somewhere\r\n\r\n$ cd <name>/Nomic-Rules\r\n$ cabal install\r\n$ cd ../Nomic \r\n$ cabal install\r\n\r\n\r\nExecution\r\n=========\r\n\r\nLaunch with the command:\r\n\r\n$ Nomic\r\n\r\nand follow the instructions. You may connect using a web browser or a command line remote terminal like telnet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTroubleshooting\r\n===============\r\n\r\ncompiling from the sources, if you have this kind of problem:\r\n\r\n$ cabal install\r\nResolving dependencies...\r\ncabal: cannot configure digestive-functors-0.1.0.1. It requires mtl >=2.0.0.0\r\n&& <3\r\nFor the dependency on mtl >=2.0.0.0 && <3 there are these packages:\r\nmtl-2.0.0.0 and mtl-2.0.1.0. However none of them are available.\r\nmtl-2.0.0.0 was excluded because mtl-1.1.0.2 was selected instead\r\nmtl-2.0.0.0 was excluded because hslogger-1.0.12 requires mtl ==1.1.0.2\r\n(...)\r\n\r\nThen try to unregister all incriminated packages.\r\nThis could include:\r\n$ghc-pkg unregister blaze-html\r\n$ghc-pkg unregister happstack-state\r\n$ghc-pkg unregister happstack-data\r\n$ghc-pkg unregister happstack-util\r\n$ghc-pkg unregister happstack-server\r\n$ghc-pkg unregister web-routes\r\n$ghc-pkg unregister web-routes-happstack\r\n$ghc-pkg unregister digestive-functors\r\n$ghc-pkg unregister digestive-functors-blaze\r\n$ghc-pkg unregister digestive-functors-happstack\r\n$ghc-pkg unregister monads-fd\r\n$ghc-pkg unregister MaybeT\r\n$ghc-pkg unregister Nomic-Rules\r\n$ghc-pkg unregister mtl\r\n$ghc-pkg unregister hslogger\r\n\r\nThen re-run install command:\r\n$ cabal install\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
